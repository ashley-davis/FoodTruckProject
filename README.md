FoodTruckProject is my Week Two assignment in Skill Distillery coding bootcamp. 

This project is a program that collects and compiles information from the user about up to 5 food trucks.

The program assigns an ID number which increments up by one for every selection.


**Overview**
Food Truck Project is a display of the skills and concepts learned in Skill Distillery Week Two. 

I was able to implement new skills in creating objects, constructors, and arrays. 

I also built on previous concepts from Week One, for example, switches, using the scanner to recieve input from the user, and basic Java syntax. 

I have come a LONG WAY in just 2 weeks.

Pretty amazing how much someone can learn when they drink through a firehose.

**How to Run**
Program begins by prompting the user to enter the name of up to 5 food trucks. 

The user is asked to name the type of food, and a numeric rating. 

The user has the option of seeing a list of the trucks they entered, seeing an average rating, and seeing the highest rated truck.
